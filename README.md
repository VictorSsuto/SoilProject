# SoilProject
### This project is done in the scope of the iOT class (420-N55-LA) at Champlain College Regional 

Soil project aims to help users determinating the **ammount of light** their plants are getting and the **humidity index** of their plants while using **arduino sensors** and **device**. These devices are tied to a **python** environment which allows to view the information gatthered by the front end with **aggregation/pipeline** and **time series collection**. The information is then stored in **MongoDB**.

# Target audience: 

This project aims to please anyone that want to take care of their plants while using the Internet of Things (iOT).
